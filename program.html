    <div class="why">
        <p>"There's a way to do it better- find it." - Thomas Edison. This quote is what I will stand by for my entire life. My peaking interest in innovation and engineering is what attracts me more and more towards the catalyst program. Through my involvement in this program, I wish to colaborate with like-minded individuals and put my curious mind to work by solving ethical problems with efficient solutions. My hunger for knowledge keeps driving me towards paths that can help me hone existing skills and build new ones; thus, bringing me upon uw's catalyst program. <br> <br> What I can put on the table: <br> --> I'm a team player. I collaborate efficiently to my max potential and believe in piecing together the team's idea's to create an astonishing final product. <br> --> I manage time effciently. Through previous competitions and events, I have learnt to manage and allocate time to ensure I am reaching my max potential at all times. <br> --> Technical Skills: I have competence in coding languages including HTML5 and CSS (which this website was coded on), Python, and Javascript. I wish to further augment and gain better competence in these languages through the catalyst program.</p>
