    <div class="about">
        <p>I'm a lot of things. I like to code, I avidly play the guitar, I absolutely love anything related to business and health sciences. I'm currently exploring the world of cryptocurrency and the metaverse, 2 topics that caught my attention. My interests are scattered all over the place, but this does not change my passion and desire for innovation, science, and engineering. I am an individual constantly seeking new opportunities that put my mind to work when it comes to innovation implementing sciences and engineering. This passion also reflects on the <a href="extracurricular.html" style="color: white">extracurricular activities</a> I participate in. <br><br> When I'm not in school learning, I like to dedicate time towards playing the guitar and coding. These activites help stimulate my mind, and work towards something productive while having a lot of fun at the same time. My interests are all over the place, which is what I like about myself. My exploratory behaviour constantly motivates me to learn new things apart of new topics that I am not familiar with. This craving for exploring practically anything I am not familiar with worked towards developing my leadership skills too. I love getting together with new people to figure out solutions for given scenarios, as multiple minds are better than one. Simple things like such bring great joy to me.</p>
